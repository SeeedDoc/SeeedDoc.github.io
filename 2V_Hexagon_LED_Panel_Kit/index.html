<h2>  Cautious </h2>
<pre><font color="red">This LED panel only supports the 2V rated voltage LED like the red, yellow, orange LED. If you use the 3v LED such as Green one soldered on the panel, it will be burned out.
So, be careful which color LED  you soldered on the panel. An easy way to distinguish the LED is using a 3v Button Cell to test the LED.
