<p>3V LED Panel is the extension pack for <a href="/3V_Hexagon_LED_Panel_Kit" title="3V Hexagon LED Panel Kit">3V Hexagon LED Panel Kit</a>. It's designed for the abecedarian to learn how to solder and also for who want to make colorful LED design.
</p><p>It's a simple hexagon LED Panel and it is easy for you to solder the various color LEDs on it.
Several panels can be connect together to compose a large LED panel, and the two panels can be connected firmly just by soldering two LEDs between them. 
The Panel supports 3V LEDs like green, blue, purple or white. It is different from the <a href="/2V_LED_Panel" title="2V LED Panel">2V LED Panel</a>.
</p><p>It includes one red hexagon PCB, 27pcs green LEDs and some electron components. With this pack, you can connect the PCB and design your own shinning LED Panel in different style.

<h2>  Cautious </h2>
<pre><font color="red">This LED panel only supports the 3V rated voltage LED like Green, Blue, Purple and White LED. If you use the 2v LED such as the Red one soldered on the panel, it will be burned out.
So, be careful which color LED  you soldered on the panel. An easy way to distinguish the LED is using a 3v Button Cell to test the LED.
