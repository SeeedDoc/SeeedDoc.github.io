<h2>  What is wearable technology? </h2>
<p>Wearable technology (wearables for short) is a device that is worn and controlled by the user to augment knowledge, enhance experience, or improve lifestyle. This industry started to grow when Pebble raised over ten million on Kickstarter, and has continued to gain popularity with Google Glass and rumors for Apple’s iWatch. Currently there are 127 products, with average price $389. Applications of wearables span medical, fitness, gaming, lifestyle, and entertainment areas, and you can learn more about it <a href="http://vandrico.com/database">here</a>

<h2>  The Intel Competition </h2>
<p>If you’re as excited about wearables as we are, you should enter the Intel Makeit Competition! If you win, you will receive help to bring your ideas to the market, and make your imagination a reality. For more information, please see the official website: (link <a href="http://makeit.intel.com/">here</a>)

<h2>  What is Xadow? </h2>
<p>Xadow is an Arduino compatible board based on the Atmega32U4 chip.  It’s extremely thin and small, with a wide range of functional modules. You can also stack and chain the modules together. Xadow is one of the smallest and most unobtrusive chips, ideal for supplying computing power to wearable products.
Supplemental modules include: LED, OLED, NFC, BLE, Barometer, Compass, Accelerometer, GPS, RTC, Vibration Motor, Buzzer, Adaptor, Storage, and Breakout
